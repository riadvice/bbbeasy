The word **Hivevlet** is a combination of 2 words. **Hive** üêù, structure for housing domesticated honeybees, which is
an

manager experience easy behind the very wide choice of managing all the configurable features of BigBlueButton.

  courses...

* Conference rooms configuration without redundancy.
* Rooms categorisation by labelling.
* Roles with customisable permissions' matrix.
* Easy to install with the minimum system command line knowledge.
